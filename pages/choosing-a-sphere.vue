			Choosing what type of sphere to use was no easy task. I needed a sphere that had an even distribution of
			detail and a high level of control over the resolution of the mesh.

		<h2 id="uv-sphere">UV Sphere</h2>
		<p>
			The default option is an UV sphere, which is evenly divided into rows and columns. This allows for a high
			level of granularity of control over the mesh's detail, which is one half of the equation. However, this
			type of sphere has the problem of having a higher density of faces and vertices near the poles of the
			sphere. This would not work well for my purposes because I don't want the planet to have higher levels of
			details near the poles.

		<h2 id="ico-sphere">Ico Sphere</h2>
		<p>
			A second option would be to use an ico sphere, which has equally sized triangles. This gives me an even
			distribution of detail across the sphere. However, due to the nature of triangles, I can only increase the
			number of faces by a factor of four. This gives me very little granularity and control of how detailed the
			sphere is.

		<h2 id="cube-sphere">Cube-based Sphere</h2>
		<p>
			The third option is to start with a cube, and then normalize every vertices position from the center. This
			creates a sphere has a very even distribution of detail, with only slightly higher level of detail near the
			seams where the sides of the cube have come together. It also gives me a high granularity of detail as I can
			divide the sides of the cube into as many faces as I'd like.
		</p>

		<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			Using a cube-based sphere turned out great. It satisfied all of my requirements and the math needed to
			create it was fairly simple. The only downside is that there is a small artifact along the seams where they
			sometimes just don't quite connect. There is a solution that solves the problem, which is to merge vertices
			that are really close to each other, connecting the small gaps. However, and of course there's always a
			catch, merging nearby vertices takes about 0.5 seconds of compute time on my powerful desktop computer. This
			performance hit is certainly not worth the small benefit of eliminating a rare and difficult to spot
			artifact.
