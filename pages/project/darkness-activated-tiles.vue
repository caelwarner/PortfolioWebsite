		<p>
			Darkness Activated Tiles is a module for the virtual tabletop FoundryVTT, which allows you to play games
			like Dungeons & Dragons online. This module is written in JavaScript and it has close to 100 thousand
			downloads. It's function is to show and hide things on the canvas based off of the light level of the
			canvas. This project was more of a challenge than I anticipated because it was difficult to learn the API
			for FoundryVTT which was badly documented and written in a dynamically typed language. I wasn't afforded any
			of the IDE luxuries of a statically typed language making navigating the codebase a real pain.
