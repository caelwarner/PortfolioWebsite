			My portfolio site is built using <NuxtLink to="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt.js</NuxtLink> and
			<NuxtLink to="https://threejs.org/">three.js</NuxtLink>. Nuxt.js is a static site generator for Vue.js, a JS
			framework. Three.js is used to render 3D elements in real-time on the page, like the planet and laptops on
			this site.
		</p>


		<h2 id="planet">Planet</h2>
		<p>
			The planet is procedurally generated every time the page is reloaded. It's made by placing vertices and then
			connecting them all together into tris and faces and eventually the whole mesh. Noise is then used to deform
			the sphere to create terrain. Finally colour is added and the planet is rendered onto the page. But, while I
			can summarize the whole process in a couple of sentences the actual process went through many more
			trials and tribulations like any good programming project.

		<h2 id="creating-the-sphere">Creating the Sphere</h2>
		<p>
			Creating the sphere was the first challenge to overcome. There are many different ways of arranging vertices
			and faces to create a sphere, each coming with their own advantages and disadvantages. I went with a
			normalized sphere where I start with a cube and then morph it to make a sphere. Read how I choose which type
			of sphere to use <NuxtLink to="/choosing-a-sphere">here</NuxtLink>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To construct the sphere I went one side of the cube at a time, creating a grid of vertices then connecting
			them together into tris that then make faces. Then create six of these sides and orient them to make a cube.
			The last step is easy, only one line of code, normalize each vertices position from the center to create a
			sphere.

		</div>


		<h2 id="noise">Noise</h2>
		<p>
			The next step is to deform the sphere using noise. I can layer more noise with smaller scales on top to
			create detail. This gives me large deformations in the terrain like mountains and valleys as well as small
			deformations that make up the detail.

			To add more detail and interest to the planet I can use multiple different noise generators with different
			settings. I have the default noise generator that creates general waviness in the terrain. And then I have a
			ridge noise generator which is very similar to the default noise generator, except all the noise values are
			fed through the formula <code>y = (1 - |sin(x)|)^2</code>.

		<p>
			Once the formula is graphed, you can see how it pushes the noise values into sharp peaks and wide troughs.
			This creates sharp ridges lines which form into expansive mountain ranges.

		<h2 id="colour">Colour</h2>
		<p>
			Adding colour is a fairly simple endeavour. I assign colour to each vertex based off of it elevation.
			A gradient is built of colours at different elevations; starting from the ocean colour, then going to the
			general ground colour, then the mountain colour and then the peak colour.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most challenging part of adding colour is creating the gradient. How do I smoothly get from one colour to
			another? The solution to this problem is so elegant. I treat colour as a 3D space where each axis is a
			different colour: red, green and blue.

		</div>
		<p class="margin-top">
			I then insert my two colours as points in this 3D space. All that's left to do is to draw a line and move
			along that line to fill in my gradient. Stringing multiple of these gradients together gives me the full
			gradient of different elevations.

		<h2 id="final-steps">Final Steps</h2>
		<p>
			After completing the planet I was able to integrate it into this Vue.js site. I then later switched to using
			Nuxt.js for performance improvements. With the framework shift and just general code optimizations I was
			able to improve the planet generation performance by a full order of magnitude. Read my process
			<NuxtLink to="/improving-planet-performance">here</NuxtLink>. The final thing left to do was polishing the
			site which of course took way longer than expected.
		</p>

		<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			Through my journey of creating a procedurally generated 3D planet that renders on a web page I've learnt
			many things like some of the unique quirks of JavaScript and how those effect performance, and how to use
			TypeScript in vanilla JS and in Vue.js. And I've ended up with this professional portfolio and blog site. I
			couldn't be happier with the outcome.
